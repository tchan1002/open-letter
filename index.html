  Two years ago, I had the opportunity to work in Hong Kong for a summer, where my grandparents still live. That summer, in fact, they were my roommates. We lived in one room, outfitted with a balcony which served as clothes-line, showerstall, and bathroom. Used to the amenities of space, it felt odd to compress myself into so little. The heat stifled.

  That's how the city felt to me then. 7 million in 400 square miles. There's not much space so the city shoots up. Everywhere I looked were another set of windows. To and fro work I yearned to find a corner untouched. To section off a piece of land and say <i>I'm the king of this hill</i>.

  I would only realize later that this was a destructive instinct. A surprisingly human one at that. It's a philosophy of ownership that seeds expansion. We've seen this in the Americas, we've seen this in Rome. We've seen it in space.

  The internet is a new frontier, and like any space, we must consider our relationship with it. We can be a producer, a visitor, or a curator, but we cannot be an owner. To try and own it, to section off its parts is to enter a chain reaction of destruction.

  Here's one space I maintain and am glad to share with you.
