      I Ordered New Covers (1/28)
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      A week ago, I noticed a tear in the cover of my comforter. I must have nicked it. I let it be. 
      <br><br>
      The tear grew steadily. It widened every time a part of me caught the sheets. First a toe, then a whole leg.
      <br><br>
      A couple days ago, the tear became insurmountable. It was going to swallow me whole.
      <br><br>
      I went online and ordered a new set of covers, which are olive green.

        Technotitlan (1/27)
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        One map has always fascinated me—it’s a bird's eye view of Tenochtitlán. A city floating upon a blue expanse, two roads bisecting it in the shape of a cross. Behind are snow-capped mountains without end. Look closer and the city is a grid arrayed by canals. On its outskirts green chinampas. In Tenochtitlan today, you’d find instead the sprawling urban expanse of Mexico City—no water in sight. How can that be?
        <br><br>
        First-time travelers to Mexico may be wary of Montezuma’s Revenge, a euphemism for traveler’s diarrhea. Those in the CDMX understand that the city is slowly sinking into the earth at a rate of up to 20 inches per year. This sinking has presented enormous challenges to the city’s potable water infrastructure.
        <br><br>
        Those who know Tenochtitlán know that the city lies in a caldera. When the Spanish conquered the city in 1519, they also drained it, not understanding its ramifications. Five centuries later, Mexican researchers are restoring chinampas to combat climate change. In an era of rapid expansion, perhaps we need to look towards indigenous wisdom to solve the challenges of the future.

        The 3% Rule (1/26)
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The 3% Rule is Virgil Abloh's Pareto Principle. <br><br>Less than 3% of DNA separates a human from a chimpanzee. <br><br> Less than 3% of code separates Airbnb from Shopify. <br><br> The key is distinguishing the 3% from the 97%, determining what requires thought and what can be boilerplate. <br><br> To confuse the two is to risk, at best, inefficiency, and at worst, the very things that define us.

        Hello Internet (1/22)
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Two years ago, I had the opportunity to work in Hong Kong for a summer, where my grandparents still live. That summer, in fact, they were my roommates. We lived in one room, outfitted with a balcony which served as clothes-line, showerstall, and bathroom. I was ill-prepared. The heat stifled.
        <br><br>
        That's how the city felt to me then. 7 million in 400 square miles. There's not much space, so the city shoots up. Everywhere I looked were another set of windows. To and fro work I yearned to find a corner untouched. To section off a piece of land and say <i>I'm the king of this hill</i>.
        <br><br>
        I would only realize later that this was a destructive instinct. A surprisingly human one at that. It's a philosophy of ownership that seeds expansion. We've seen this in the Americas, we've seen this in Rome. We've seen it in space.
        <br><br>
        The internet is one sort of space. Though it may seem infinite, we must consider our relationship with it. We can be a producer, a visitor, or a curator, but we cannot be an owner. To try and own it, to section off its parts is to enter a chain reaction of destruction.

        Here's one space I maintain and am glad to share with you.
